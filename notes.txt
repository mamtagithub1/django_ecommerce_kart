Introduction to Custom User Model::--
Q1. Why to use cutomize user model?
Ans: In general for login there use mail-id and password,but in django by default(by-default user model) it have useername&password option ,which is not convienent/right way to ask for login(e.g: advanced application via;e-commerce ), Cuz of which will make a custom user model to ask for mail-id instead of username in django to login
